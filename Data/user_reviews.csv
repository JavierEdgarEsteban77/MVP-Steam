In my opinion does ""zombie"" hordes and team work better than left 4 dead plus has a global leveling system. Alot of down to earth ""zombie"" splattering fun for the whole family. Amazed this sort of FPS is so rare."

You don't get any of that cliche game mechanics that all the latest games have, this is simply good core gameplay. Yes, you can't 360 noscope your friends, but what you can do is show them up with your bad ♥♥♥ dance moves and put them to shame as you show them what true fashion and color combinations are.I know this game says for kids but, this is easily for any age range and any age will have a blast playing this.8/8"
js41637,http://steamcommunity.com/id/js41637,"Posted September 8, 2013.",227300,True,"For a simple (it's actually not all that simple but it can be!) truck driving Simulator, it is quite a fun and relaxing game. Playing on simple (or easy?) its just the basic WASD keys for driving but (if you want) the game can be much harder and realistic with having to manually change gears, much harder turning, etc. And reversing in this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥, as I imagine it would be with an actual truck. Luckily, you don't have to reverse park it but you get extra points if you do cause it is bloody hard. But this is suprisingly a nice truck driving game and I had a bit of fun with it."

doctr,http://steamcommunity.com/id/doctr,"Posted October 14, 2013.",250320,True,"This game... is so fun. The fight sequences have been improved from walking dead. It also includes more of a Sam and Max puzzle solving (some of it in the first episode) and walking dead. The game also gets even more better if you have read the Fables comic books, which are without a doubt, very good. The music is also superb and fit the scenarios very well."
doctr,http://steamcommunity.com/id/doctr,"Posted July 28, 2012.",20920,True,"Really Really Really Great Game, very good story, im in chapter 1 atm and i think its great. You get a really early link with characters. No need to play the first game, its nicely wrapped up for you in a five minute video. FYI beware of the sex scenes :P, nudity does happen in the game and it shows you actually having sex, so try not to play with your parents around if your near a point in the story. Also you will need a good rig/comp to play on high. Don't even try running the game on Ultra unless you have mulitiple GPU's (Graphics card) and ram and a good processor. All in all good game :D"

But since its release in July 2011, it grown to become an outstanding example of Enthusiasm, Humor, and Profound triamph in a game. No matter whether your accomplishing great feats of exploration and scientific achievement......Or maybe you watched your beloved ship erupt into flames and debris becuase of a fatally unseen flaw. There is always something spectacular to be seen (Like your blown-up ship) or something to have a laugh at (Again like your blown-up ship)My recommendation?Buy this game, do something great, do something ridiculous, mod it, find something else just as great and just as crazy to do. My little tip is that i get emotionally attatched to some of my kerbals (Especially Jebediah). There's so much fun to be had and tenderness to experience. There's no reason not to buy this game and experience it. So do it!!!"
PPanther,http://steamcommunity.com/id/PPanther,"Posted June 7, 2014.",211820,True,"I've always liked games like Terraria with the 2 dimensional survival and exploration aspect and Starbound does all these well and MORE!Lets start with its soundtrack: To sum it up in one paragraph would do it injustice. This games soundtrack is fully orchestral and imersive. The music just fits perfectly where-ever you are in game. Whether you are spelunking or just flying through the vast expanse of space it fits perfectly and leaves you in awe.Ok onto the graphics: The look and feel of this game bring the vast worlds to life with the many colors and alien dirts, trees and the mixture of monsters. The backgrounds of the planets match up the the foregrounds well and give the 2d aspect that 3d feel.Now the gameplay: Starbound has a nice rich layer of gameplay revolving around survival. In the latest unstable build updates they have introduced a very needed layer of missions and npc quests which fullfil the gaps of just flying from planet to planet and give purpose.Starbounds worlds have a wide variety of random aspects to them.First off the flora: Flora of planets consists of 2-3 main aspects. The Trees, the small bushes and medium bushes. Each planet has a vast difference to the next in their flora with trees coming in 2-3 different types from metallic trees to plain out alien tentacles.Now onto the fauna: Each planet has 3 or more ground based animals which increase in strength further beneath the planets surface. Starbound has a feature where animals are customized via their limbs and body. There are many arms, legs, feet and bodies all just jumbled to together from monster to monster making cute monsters and just plain out terrifying ones. There are also around 2 bird species per planet. Using the same general system.I personally suggest this game because of its deep and fluid experience and its wide modding community.8-9/10 for an early access and its only going to get better!"

I have no idea what others are complaining about.Anyways.In my opinion i like it even slightly better than Gta 5 which i own.it has such a good story and ypu can dictate the story on several occasions like choosing to kill or not kill somebody which affects you later on positively or negativly or choosing weather to accept an offer or not.The combat is imersive. as you harm an enemy their preformance goes down and you cand shoot them a mlion times in the hand to kill them. This is still up for a little improvementsMods can be very fun and after finishing the story i reccomend installing one after finnishing the story.However you should install an ENB asap because it greatly enhances the graphics.
